### Approaches

1. Brute force algo
    * general logic structure
    * also, the exhaustive search algo
        * search all possibilities to provide the required algo
    * 2 types
      1. optimizing: find all solutions then gv the best solution / if the best solution is known, it terminates when that value is known
      2. sacrificing: terminates when once the best solution is found
    
2. Divide & conquer
    * design an algo in step-by-step variation
    
3. Greedy algo
    * makes an optimal choice on each iteration, hoping to get the best solution
    * easy to implement, faster execution time
    * rarely provides the optimal solution
    
4. Dynamic programming
    * store the intermediate results
    * 5 steps:
        1. breaks down the problem
        2. finds optimal solution out the subproblems
        3. store the result of the subproblems
        4. reuse the result
        5. computes the result of the complex program
    
5. Branch & Bound Algo
    * applied only in Integer programming problems
    * divide all the sets of feasible solutions into smaller subsets
    * the subsets are further evaluated to find the best solution
    
6. Randomized algo
    * simpler and more efficient than the deterministic algo
    
7. Backtracking
    * solve the problem recursively
    * remove the solution if it does not satisfy the constraints
